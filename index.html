The rocks beneath our feet, like cells, record the life of the earth, containing precious traces of geological evolution. The one that impressed me the most was minerals. The crust is divided into continental crust and oceanic crust. The continental crust is composed of sedimentary layers, granite layers and basalt layers. Minerals are the basic building blocks of rocks and ores. The formation of minerals cannot be separated from endogenesis, exogenesis and metamorphism. The mineral world is colorful, with red, yellow, green, purple, orange, white and so on. Different minerals have different colors, and even the same mineral has different colors. Why do minerals have different colors? The main reason is the selective absorption of visible light by the object. The main factors that determine the color of minerals are the chemical composition, structural structure, and the degree of oxidation.

Next, I learned about “Earth memory.” The earth is changing all the time under the surface of unchanging. The rocks beneath our feet, like cells, record the life of the earth, containing precious traces of geological evolution. The one that impressed me the most was minerals. The crust is divided into continental crust and oceanic crust. The continental crust is composed of sedimentary layers, granite layers and basalt layers. Minerals are the basic building blocks of rocks and ores. The formation of minerals cannot be separated from endogenesis, exogenesis and metamorphism. The mineral world is colorful, with red, yellow, green, purple, orange, white and so on. Different minerals have different colors, and even the same mineral has different colors. Why do minerals have different colors? The main reason is the selective absorption of visible light by the object. The main factors that determine the color of minerals are the chemical composition, structural structure, and the degree of oxidation. Finally, I looked at a few other showrooms.</h2><h2 id="After-the-visit-I-developed-a-keen-interest-in-minerals-There-are-countless-mysteries-hidden-in-the-world-I-want-to-learn-more-knowledge-uncover-their-mystery-and-contribute-to-society-Embark-on-a-journey-of-discovery-More-gas"><a href="#After-the-visit-I-developed-a-keen-interest-in-minerals-There-are-countless-mysteries-hidden-in-the-world-I-want-to-learn-more-knowledge-uncover-their-mystery-and-contribute-to-society-Embark-on-a-journey-of-discovery-More-gas" class="headerlink" title="After the visit, I developed a keen interest in minerals.
