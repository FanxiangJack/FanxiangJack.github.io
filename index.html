The cable is a steel wire rope that has been rolled together, with three layers of a “Z” shape and vanadium plated on the outer ring to improve tension and corrosion protection. The roof cable net used in the football field weighs more than 2,600 tons, and the tension of a single cable exceeds 300 tons. The double-layer flexible cable net structure with upper oblique and lower radial is adopted for the first time in China.</h2><h2 id="Looking-down-on-Barracuda-Bay-football-Stadium-from-above-there-will-be-a-visual-effect-of-choppy-waves-It-is-learned-from-the-Internet-that-this-is-because-its-awning-is-the-first-time-in-China-to-adopt-a-double-layer-flexible-cable-network-structure-with-upper-oblique-and-lower-radial-and-is-covered-with-ETFE-film-The-film-material-is-modeled-through-the-cable-network-structure-to-form-a-wave-model-The-facade-is-composed-of-ETFE-cable-membrane-structure-and-flood-lighting-system-around-cable-membrane-Among-them-the-facade-adopts-ETFE-film-of-nearly-40-000-square-meters-including-9-kinds-of-blue-film-materials-7-823-diaphragms-which-is-the-largest-membrane-structure-coverage-area-of-professional-football-stadiums-in-the-world-and-the-most-single-layer-ETFE-membrane-structure-Cable-membrane-structure-firm-and-reliable-good-wind-resistance-The-membrane-material-not-only-makes-the-roof-have-a-sense-of-layering-but-also-fully-considers-the-roof-drainage-and-other-factors-during-installation-which-can-maximize-the-shade-and-rain-for-the-audience-and-ensure-the-comfort-of-watching-the-game-Despite-the-wind-blowing-the-spectators-can-enjoy-the-game-in-the-stadium"><a href="#Looking-down-on-Barracuda-Bay-football-Stadium-from-above-there-will-be-a-visual-effect-of-choppy-waves-It-is-learned-from-the-Internet-that-this-is-because-its-awning-is-the-first-time-in-China-to-adopt-a-double-layer-flexible-cable-network-structure-with-upper-oblique-and-lower-radial-and-is-covered-with-ETFE-film-The-film-material-is-modeled-through-the-cable-network-structure-to-form-a-wave-model-The-facade-is-composed-of-ETFE-cable-membrane-structure-and-flood-lighting-system-around-cable-membrane-Among-them-the-facade-adopts-ETFE-film-of-nearly-40-000-square-meters-including-9-kinds-of-blue-film-materials-7-823-diaphragms-which-is-the-largest-membrane-structure-coverage-area-of-professional-football-stadiums-in-the-world-and-the-most-single-layer-ETFE-membrane-structure-Cable-membrane-structure-firm-and-reliable-good-wind-resistance-The-membrane-material-not-only-makes-the-roof-have-a-sense-of-layering-but-also-fully-considers-the-roof-drainage-and-other-factors-during-installation-which-can-maximize-the-shade-and-rain-for-the-audience-and-ensure-the-comfort-of-watching-the-game-Despite-the-wind-blowing-the-spectators-can-enjoy-the-game-in-the-stadium" class="headerlink" title="Looking down on Barracuda Bay football Stadium from above, there will be a visual effect of choppy waves.

The film material is modeled through the cable network structure to form a wave model. The facade is composed of ETFE cable membrane structure and flood lighting system around cable membrane. Among them, the facade adopts ETFE film of nearly 40,000 square meters, including 9 kinds of blue film materials, 7,823 diaphragms, which is the largest membrane structure coverage area of professional football stadiums in the world and the most single-layer ETFE membrane structure.
